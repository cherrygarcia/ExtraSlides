    <h2>Conceptual Framework</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    <!---
as i go thgouth and show ho w i tried to address these things in the dissertation, it may be helpful to see how i envision the relationship between living in a disadvantaged neighborhood and mental illness. 
ND itself is not risk factor for poor mental health, but is thought to instead be a proxy for specific neighborhood features tha are risk factors. collective efficacy and violence are two such niehgborhood features that have strong evidence bases. 
I think in between those could come something that sociologist William Julius Wilson calls “neighborhood opportunity structure.” Disadvantaged neighborhoods “offer few legitimate employment opportunities, inadequate job information networks, and poor schools” and residents “lack contact or sustained interaction” with local institutions, individuals in the formal labor market, and individuals with some college education.
In support of this, 2 quasi experimental studies, one in chicago and one in new york , found that adults who moved to low-income neighborhoods were more likely to be employed.

Regarding the upper portion of the conceptual model, a lack of neighborhood opportunity structure may create an effort-reward imbalance, because legitimate efforts by residents of low-opportunity neighborhoods to improve their situation (effort) are likely to be ineffective (lack of reward), because of the “systematic blockage of opportunities"." Research suggests that an effort-reward imbalance results in individuals feeling powerless, with little motivation and self-esteem, --effectly stymying collective effecacy- 

these qualities have been shown to be predictive of dysregulation of the stress response system in both humand and primates. and are also predictive of reduced hippocampal volume and depression. 

Regarding the lower portion of the conceptual model, low collective efficacy has been shown to be associated with increased community violence. In addition residents of neighborhoods with low opportunity structure are likely to be unemployed and/or out of the labor force, which increases the “likelihood that the residents will rely on illegitimate sources of income.” Because these illegitimate methods may be a target for police, this may also act to increase neighborhood violence.

The possibility of threat in violent neighbrhoods results in repeated or prolonged activation of the stress response system,  This association between neighborhood violences and markers of dysregulation of the stress response system has been shown by severl research groups. 

dysregulation of the stress response system--and in particular, cortisol dysregulation and elevated levels are associated with depression. Cortisol levels actually remain elevated for the duration of the major depressive episode, and have been shown to reduce hippocampal volume. This reduced hippocampal volume has also been associated with anxiety disorders like PTSD

Cushing’s disease is e↵ectively treated by removing the tumor, which allows cortisol levels to return to normal. [98]

<!---
In addition, 
We repeated our analysis using the 25th, 20th, 15th, 10th, and 5th percentile as cut-points. The disadvantage, though, is that our the sample size in our matched datasets gets progressively smaller with each smaller cutpointThe association between neighborhood disadvantage and cortisol slope remained significant for all cut-points except the 5th percentile. could be because the sample size of the matched dataset was greatly reduced in this case (from N=867 to N=148 for the first imputation).

We then applied these methods to our example from Aim 2. 
Figure on teh left shows in red dots the extent to which (1) NCS-A participants with cortisol mea- surements compare to participants without across possible confounding variables (red, open dots), and (2) NCS-A participants with the exposure of interest (residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood) compare to participants without (blue, closed dots). 

participants living in disadvantaged neighborhoods di↵er from those living in non-disadvantaged neighborhoods in terms of expected demo- graphic variables like race, income, and maternal education.
Those with and without cortisol measurements look similar with the exceptions of age, average bedtime on the weekends, maternal work, and the interview taking place in the summer. So if we did what was usually done in the literature, we would ignore selection into the sub-sample

Figure on teh right, shows our results
on the y axis, we see the difference in cortisol slope. 
on the x axis we have the different estimators
First, if we comare the two IPW estimators. one which does not adjust for sub-sample selection, since we didn't see big differences, IPTSvyW, and the one that does ajudst, IPW, we see that the IPW estimate is 22% larger. So in this case, even though we didn't see any big differences in the one-dimensional summary, a 22$ difference may still matter.
focusing on teh 3 estimators that address non-random tx assignment as well as selection into the survey and sub-sample (IPW, DRWLS and TMLE), we see that we get the same inference no matter which estiamtor we choose. 
In the simulation, DRWLS and TMLE performed better than IPW in terms of % bias, efficiancy, coverage and MSE. Here, though, surprisingly TMLE has a wider CI than IPW. This discrepancy likely stems from more unstable weights and practical positivity violations with the case study data. And remains us that there is a need for caution using any of these estimators in this case.
